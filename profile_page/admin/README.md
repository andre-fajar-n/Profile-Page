# Admin Structure

This directory contains the Django admin configuration for the profile_page application, organized in a modular structure.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: Contains the main admin registrations
- `forms.py`: Contains custom admin forms
- `mixins.py`: Contains reusable admin mixins

## Usage

The admin configuration is automatically loaded by Django when the application starts.

## Adding New Admin Classes

When adding new admin classes:

1. Create the admin class in `__init__.py` or in a new file
2. Register the model with the admin class in `__init__.py`
3. If needed, create custom forms in `forms.py`
4. If needed, create custom mixins in `mixins.py`

## Best Practices

- Keep admin classes focused and single-purpose
- Use mixins for shared functionality
- Use descriptive names for admin classes and methods
- Add docstrings to explain admin class purpose and behavior
